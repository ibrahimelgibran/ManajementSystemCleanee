## Source Code

The software code has been divided into four different packages:

- Data Access Object (DAO): Contains the data access layer of the software that interacts directly with the database and its tables. Used for retrieval and modification of data.
- Data Transfer Object (DTO): Contains the data transfer layer that allows the data to be transferred between the data access layer and the UI layer.
- Database: Contains the ConnectionFactory class that retrieves the database connection and verifies user credentials for the application.
- User Interface (UI): Contains all the GUI classes making up the interface layer of the software.

## Work-in-Progress

This project is a work in progress and more features are yet to be added with new technologies.
